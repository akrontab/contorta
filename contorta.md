## What

As we broach into the mid 21st century we are at a inflection point in so many different ways. As technologists, and as hackers we have lost our way. Can we still channel the DIY spirit of late 20th century punk rock? Is the maker movement still alive and viable? Is the zeitgeist and political climate of our time  calling us back? Technology is political wheather we like it or not... What will you do?
