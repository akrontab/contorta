## What

As we broach into the mid 21st century we are at a inflection point in so many different ways. As technologists, and as hackers we have lost our way. Can we still channel the DIY spirit of late 20th century punk rock? Is the maker movement still alive and viable? Is the zeitgeist and political climate of our time  calling us back? Technology is political wheather we like it or not... What will you do?

## brain dump

the turn of the century was an amazing time for technology. the Internet was alive and thriving (sans the dot com bust) and hacker groups were experiencing a golden age (cDc and l0pht). fast forward a quarter of a century and tech oligarchs run the show from their walled gardens and even individual expression and thought is stuck behind a paywall (medium and other garbage blogging platforms). wage slaves sell their expertise and labor while tech communities are driven by chasing certifications and the all mighty dollar. we've lost our edge and drive towards the finding limits of the systems around us. bug hunting is dominated by bug bounties and getting paid. money has declawed the political threat of hackers and economic slavery has replaced pure curiosity.
