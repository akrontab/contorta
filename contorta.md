## What

As we broach into the mid 21st century we are at a inflection point in so many different ways. As technologists, and as hackers we have lost our way. Can we still channel the DIY spirit of late 20th century punk rock? Is the maker movement still alive and viable? Is the zeitgeist and political climate of our time calling us back? Technology is political wheather we like it or not... What will you do?

## brain dump

the turn of the century was an amazing time for technology. the Internet was alive and thriving (sans the dot com bust) and hacker groups were experiencing a golden age (cDc and l0pht). fast forward a quarter of a century and tech oligarchs run the show from their walled gardens and even individual expression and thought is stuck behind a paywall (medium and other garbage blogging platforms). wage slaves sell their expertise and labor while tech communities are driven by chasing certifications and the all mighty dollar. we've lost our edge and drive towards the finding limits of the systems around us. bug hunting is dominated by bug bounties and getting paid. money has declawed the political threat of hackers and economic slavery has replaced pure curiosity.

Our own success has made us complacent, and dulled our edge. We now chase industry acceptance instead of our own curiosity. The hackers who came before us risked thier own futures because they had a fuck you atitude and wanted to buck the establishment. What happened to the punk rock ethos that our forefathers held while we exchanged it for white collar safety in our careers. I'm not talking about hacktivism, I'm not talking about criminal enterprises who are driven by the same dollar that those who are afraid to risk clout and reputation. Sure the landscape has changed and the technology that we treated as novel and at a periphery of our daily lives has been thrust at the forefront of how we live in the developed world, and has become so needed that without it we wouldn't know what to do. Our skills have become the way we make a living instead of the way we chose to approach living it self. We aren't weird anymore, and we live with a sense of wonder, apprecitation and even envy from normies and everyday people. We must change with the changing landscape that our mindset has birthed into the everyday lexicon. The word "hack" has become synonmous with bullshit ideas about quirky ways of making your dinner, or cleaning your house. "Hack" is now meaningless.

Has the evolution of what hacking is today to what it was 30 years ago been all bad? Absolutly not! Don't let me sit here and be the old man who is yelling to get off my lawn, and talk about how things were better in the good old days. *cough* DEFCON isn't like it used to be *cough* Times change, people change, culture changes... Politics change. We are living in such a time where the skills we spent so many hours cultivating and developing is needed more than ever. As Winn Schwartau said, "What shit hits the fan, WHAT DO YOU DO?" So... What will we do? Even what can we do? As I like to say to my kids, you work with what you have and do the best you can.

A tactic used by content troll farms is to flood the zone. Leveraging Generative AI we can come up novel content with a simple prompt and away it goes. We know how to call APIs and automate usage of Facebook and Twitter. We find ways around API usage restrictions. We can fight back against the misinformation and do it in a scalable and automated fashion. USE THE TOOLS WE HAVE AVAILABLE! Generate content, find the facebook groups spreading misinformation and endlessly hound them.

Zine culture was strong in the 1980s and 1990s in the punk rock scene. It was a form of expression for marginalized and groups on the fringes of society. One of the most famous hacker zines is 2600, and to this day it is still thriving and being published. 2600 groups around the country still meet on the first Friday of each month, and 2600 Off The Wall and Off The Hook is still being broadcast on WUSB. This is great but we need more! Phrack, POC || GTFO, and 2600 can only do so much.
