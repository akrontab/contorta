## What

As we broach into the mid 21st century we are at a inflection point in so many different ways. As technologists, and as hackers we have lost our way. Can we still channel the DIY spirit of the late 20th century punk rock scene? Is the maker movement still alive and viable? Is the zeitgeist and political climate of our time  calling us back? Technology is not apolitical... What will you do?

Let art have equal weight to the science and process. Make mistakes, fail and come up short. Art allows that.
